## Project Overview

Inspired by New York City bikeshare platform, we are trying to start a bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa. 
There is a potential investor who we would like to convince to fund this project. Despite the differences between Des Moines and NYC, we used the Citi Bike data that was published to the public, to analyze the practicality of this business in our target city. Data contains the information for August 2019. 

## Results

According to this graph, majority of the bikes were used for less than 10 minutes and hardly any of the bikes were used for longer than 1 hour.

By looking at this line chart, we can understand primary riders are males and they ride the bikes for longer periods of time.

According to this heatmap most of the users of the service are subscribers, and among both subscribers and costumers, majority of the users are males.
Thurdays are busiest day among the subscribers and Sundays have the least users. Considering this chart and the time of the day heatmap we can realize that the best time for maintenance and repair of the bikes are Sundays between 2am-7am.

The last two maps show that suburbs have the least number of users and most users are within the city and around businesses and tourist attractions. 
Most of the popular starting points are also popular end locations, showing that users haven't used bikes for long distances. 


## Summary

In summary our analysis shows that males are the primary users of the bikeshare service and are the majority of subscribers. It can be seen that rush hours are the busiest time of the usage and can be realized that the bikes are used for commute around the city when the traffic is heaviest. Additionally, it was vicible that rural areas and suburbs have the least users and are not popular areas for the service. 

To better study the practicality of starting a bikeshare company in Des Moines additional visualizations can be beneficial:
 - Age of the users can also be a factor 
 - Comparing the cost of using public transportation to the bikeshare service. 
 - Average mileage of rides at different days and times.
